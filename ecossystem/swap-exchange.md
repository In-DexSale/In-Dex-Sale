# ðŸ”¥ Swap Exchange

****:clap:**It is generally based on a series of mathematical and economic formulations that seek to create a balanced medium that allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies safely.**, and thus avoid risky or counterproductive situations for transactions.

Unlike traditional exchanges, AMM-type DEXs are completely autonomous and their entire operation is algorithmic, as indicated in the [**smart contracts**](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-are-smart-contracts/) that make its operation possible. A good example of this type of DEX is [**uniswap**](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/what-is-uniswap/), which was one of the first to use the AMM model for trading on its platform.
