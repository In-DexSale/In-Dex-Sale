# ðŸ“Œ Bridge

:clap:Trustless bridges are those which users donâ€™t have to place trust in a single entity or authority. Rather, the trust is placed on mathematical truth built into the code.

This removes many of the problems of centralized systems, which are open to corruption or abuse of power, by using transparency and incentivization of widespread participation.
