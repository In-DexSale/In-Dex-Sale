## **What is NFT staking?** <a href="#what-is-nft-staking" id="what-is-nft-staking"></a>

In a regular staking pool, users deposit tokens into a contract and are rewarded with the same or different token in the form of rewards.**An NFT staking pool is different** and is a bit similar to the Farming Pools because as a user, you:

1. 1.Deposit In-Dex Sale tokens into a contract.
2. 2.Get rewarded with NFT cards with different rarities and characteristics (The better your NFT is, the higher your mining power will be)
3. 3.Stake the NFT cards in the NFT Pool.
4. 4.Earn In-Dex Div.

### **PLEASE NOTE THAT:** <a href="#please-note-that" id="please-note-that"></a>

* **NFT casting is a random process. Users will be rewarded with different cards depending on their luck!**
* **NFTs can be decomposed back to In-Dex but will have a decomposition time. This means the tokens will be locked for a certain time in the NFT cards. The decomposition time is also chosen randomly and is set between (25 - 45days).**
* **NFT Cards can be traded in the NFT marketplace in our platform (will open soon).**

The NFT staking pools are available in the pool section in our platform.
