# ðŸ«‚ NFTs

:clap:In-Dex Sale is building a new NFT Game and introducing Crypto NFTs as a new feature. Users can cast NFTs with unique characteristics and different rarities (by depositing IDXS tokens) then staking.

## **What is NFT staking?** <a href="#what-is-nft-staking" id="what-is-nft-staking"></a>

:clap:In a regular staking pool, users deposit tokens into a contract and are rewarded with the same or different token in the form of rewards. **A NFT staking pool is different** and it is a bit similar to the Farming Pools. As a user, you:

1. Deposit IDXS tokens into a contract.
2. Get rewarded with NFT cards with different rarities and characteristics (The better your NFT is, the higher your mining power will be)
3. Stake the NFT cards into the NFT Pool.
4. Earn IDXS Div.

### **PLEASE NOTE THAT:**

* **NFT casting is a random process. Users will be rewarded with different cards depending on their luck.**
* **NFTs can be decomposed back to IDXS but will have a decomposition time. This means the tokens will be locked for a certain time in the NFT cards. The decomposition time is also chosen randomly and is set between 25 â€“ 45 days.**
* **NFT Cards can be traded in the NFT marketplace in our platform (coming soon).**

The NFT staking pools are available in the pool section in our platform.
