**Main Problems with current launchpads**&#x20;

Limited to one ecosystem - Most existing launchpads are limited to one single ecosystem such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Polkadot and others.

High cost of participation - Participating in a launch requires tens of thousands (and sometimes hundreds of thousands) of dollars.

Short term impact - The majority of the promotional impact fades with the launch of followup projects.

Unfair - While perhaps less common, it is well known that some launchpads use bots and different manipulation tactics in order to insure most of the offered allocations end up under their control.

Limited token dispersion - Most launchpads only allow, or are able to attract, a few hundred participants to take part in an IDO, limiting the number of participants and thus the project supporters.

High cost of listing - Listing with a launchpad comes, in most cases, with an associated marketing fee.

Centralized control - Launchpads decide which projects get listed, sometimes for the wrong reasons.\
